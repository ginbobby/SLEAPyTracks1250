## What is this repository for? ##



This is a tracker for tracking exploration behavior of the red knot. Currently trained for use on red knot exploration tests.
Runs a trained SLEAP model over multiple videos and returns tracking data as a csv file.

Sinds SLEAP version 1.3.3 this program is mostly deprecated.

* Version 0.2.0

## Installation ##

SLEAPyTracks uses the SLEAP library. So first we install SLEAP using miniconda.

The following instructions are for Windows

### Install Miniconda ###

Anaconda is a Python environment manager that makes it easy to install SLEAP and its necessary dependencies without affecting other Python software on your computer.

Miniconda is a lightweight version of Anaconda. To install it:

Go to: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links

Download the latest version for your OS.

Follow the installer instructions.



### Install SLEAP ###

open "Anaconda Powershell Prompt" from the start menu

First we install SLEAP.

Copy the following line in the Anaconda powershell and press enter:

```bash
conda create -y -n sleap -c sleap -c nvidia -c conda-forge sleap=1.3.0
```

Wait until the installation is finished.

After installing SLEAP install ffmpeg by coping the following line into the shell and pressing enter:

```bash
conda install -n sleap ffmpeg
```


If you don't have git installed already, you can also install it with Miniconda:

```bash
conda install git
```


### Install SLEAPyTracks ###

Clone the SLEAPyTracks repo from GitHub

in the Anaconda powershell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aavanderleij/SLEAPyTracks.git
```

To reinstall or update SLEAPyTracks its recommended to remove the SLEAPyTracks folder and clone the repo again.

Remember to save any tracking files you want to keep somewhere else 
## Usage ##

with the Anaconda powershell start the sleap virtual environment

```bash
conda activate sleap
```

with the Anaconda powershell go into the map for SLEAPyTracks

```bash
cd SLEAPyTracks
```
run SLEAPyTracks on the directory you want to track

```bash
python SLEAPyTracks "path/to/your/video_dir/location/"
```

Default output location can be found in the video directory under "predictions/"

Files are saved as csv files

### more options: ###

direct output to different directory

```bash
python SLEAPyTracks "path/to/your/video_dir/location/" -o "path/to/output"
```


track more than one animal in a video (e.g 3 animals):

```bash
python SLEAPyTracks "path/to/your/video_dir/location/" -t -n 3
```
